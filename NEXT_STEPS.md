# Next Steps for GitHub Pages Deployment

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created
- [x] Vite configuration optimized for GitHub Pages
- [x] Git LFS configuration for PLY files
- [x] Build process tested and working
- [x] Code splitting implemented (reduced bundle sizes)
- [x] Deployment documentation created

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Git LFS (Important!)
Before first deployment, you need to migrate the large PLY files:

```bash
# Install Git LFS if not already installed
git lfs install

# Migrate existing PLY files to LFS
git lfs migrate import --include="*.ply"

# Push the migrated files
git push origin main --force
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. Site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/gsplat-showcase/`

### 4. Update Repository Name (if needed)
If your repository name is different from "gsplat-showcase":
1. Update the `base` field in `vite.config.js`
2. Commit and push the change

## üåê Domain Migration (Phase 2)

### Preparation (48 hours before)
1. **Lower DNS TTL** in Squarespace to 300 seconds
2. **Test GitHub Pages** deployment on temporary URL
3. **Plan maintenance window** (low-traffic time)

### Migration Day
1. **Update DNS records** in Squarespace:
   ```
   A Records: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153
   CNAME (www): yourusername.github.io
   ```
2. **Add custom domain** in GitHub Pages settings
3. **Monitor DNS propagation** (1-24 hours)
4. **Enable HTTPS** once SSL certificate is issued

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Test all functionality on new domain
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Update any hardcoded URLs
- [ ] Celebrate the $150+ annual savings! üéâ

## üìä Current Status
- **Build size optimized**: Three.js split into separate chunks
- **PLY files**: 101MB total, ready for Git LFS
- **Bundle analysis**: 
  - three.js: 471KB (118KB gzipped)
  - Application code: 30KB (8KB gzipped)
  - Styles: 12.6KB (2.8KB gzipped)

## üí° Optional Improvements
- Set up automated lighthouse performance monitoring
- Add Plausible or Google Analytics
- Consider PWA features for offline usage
- Implement lazy loading for large models

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember
- Git LFS has usage limits (1GB free storage/bandwidth per month)
- DNS propagation can take up to 72 hours
- Keep Squarespace active until migration is confirmed working
- Have rollback plan ready during domain migration
