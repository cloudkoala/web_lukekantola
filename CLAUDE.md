# Gaussian Splat Showcase - Claude Development History

## Project Overview
A Three.js-based point cloud viewer built specifically for showcasing Gaussian splat models. Originally started with gsplat.js but migrated to Three.js for better camera control and animation capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Point Cloud Rendering**: Displays PLY files with automatic scaling and centering
- **Advanced Camera System**: Quaternion-based animations with smooth interpolation
- **Orbital Controls**: Automated orbital camera movement around selected points
- **Loading Animation**: 5-second cinematic intro sequence on every page load
- **Camera Presets**: Save/load custom camera positions (Top, Front, Side views)
- **Real-time Controls**: Adjustable point size, rotation speed, and interaction modes
- **Retro UI**: Terminal-style interface with Space Mono font and collapsible controls

## Development Guidelines
- **Allow Sliders to go to 0 by default unless they should be 0 centered or giving a 0 value for that parameter would case a bug**
